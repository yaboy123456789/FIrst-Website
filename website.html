    <h2>Sons Of The Forest</h2>
       <img src="sotf.jpg"></img> I like to play games.This is Sons Of The Forest. This game is probably one of my favorites the realism in it is crazy! This game is a sequal 
    from The Forest and this game is The Sons Of The Forest and you are in control of protagonist which is in fact the son in the first forest.
    You were sent to find a billionair but instead you get shot down in your helicopter and get stuck on the island and you are left to survive while being challanged 
    by caniables trying to kill you.

    <h2>BeamNG.drive</h2>
       <img src="beam.jpg"></img>Another game I like to play in my freetime is BeamNG.drive which is a vehicle simulation video game and I like this game because 
       its a cool game to just mess around on. BeamNG.drive has soft-body physics, which simulates realistic handling and 
       damage to vehicles just like real life. So you can make a bus hit 13 trucks if you wanted to or you can tune cars and have fun racing Ai.
